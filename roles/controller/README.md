## Requirements

This role will work with any Ansible Automation Platform 2.1+ version of Ansible Controller, but is intended to be used with Ansible on Clouds deployments.

## Role Variables

### Extra Vars

There are many variables that can be set, with the required variables defined in `defaults/main.yml`.  Below is an example of what is in the file.  Of all the variables set by default, there is one that **must** be set in your extra vars:

| Key              | Description                                                                          |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ssh_public_key` | The public key used to connect to and manage Linux VMs created in certain playbooks. |

```yaml
---
# Required
ssh_public_key: "{{ lookup('file', '~/.ssh/id_rsa_azure_demo.pub') }}"

# Optional
awx_organization: Default
azure.region: eastus
azure.resource_group: ansible_test
windows_admin_password: ansible12345!
```

### Environment Vars

Set the environment variables on your local machine that are required for credentials that will be added to Ansible Controller:

| Variable Name           | Description                                                                    |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `CONTROLLER_HOST`       | The hostname of AAP controller to automate against                             |
| `CONTROLLER_USERNAME`   | Used to authenticate against the Ansible Controller API                        |
| `CONTROLLER_PASSWORD`   | Used to authenticate against the Ansible Controller API                        |
| `AZURE_TENANT_ID`       | Used to configure the Azure subscription credential in Automation Controller   |
| `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` | Used to configure the Azure subscription credential in Automation Controller   |
| `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`       | Used to configure the Azure subscription credential in Automation Controller   |
| `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`   | Used to configure the Azure subscription credential in Automation Controller   |
| `RED_HAT_ACCOUNT`       | Used to configure the Red Hat subscription credential in Automation Controller |
| `RED_HAT_PASSWORD`      | Used to configure the Red Hat subscription credential in Automation Controller |

You can set the variables in your shell with a one-liner:

```bash
export CONTROLLER_HOST="" CONTROLLER_USERNAME="username" CONTROLLER_PASSWORD="password" AZURE_TENANT_ID="" AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="" AZURE_CLIENT_ID="" AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET="" RED_HAT_ACCOUNT="" RED_HAT_PASSWORD=""
```
